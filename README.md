# 🏀 HomeCourt AI – Predicting NBA Home Team Wins with Machine Learning

**HomeCourt AI** is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether the home team will win a given NBA game using over 75 years of professional basketball data. It showcases skills in data engineering, feature selection, modeling, and (soon) deployment — all tied together in a real-world sports analytics application.

> ⚡ **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, NumPy\
> 📊 **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees *(XGBoost planned)*\
> 🚀 **Next Steps**: Model API, Streamlit dashboard, live data integration

## 📌 Project Highlights

✅ Built a binary classification model to predict home team wins\
✅ Engineered features from player, team, and game stats (1946–present)\
✅ Cleaned and merged multiple complex CSV datasets\
✅ Designed modular code for data prep, training, and evaluation\
✅ Visualized performance with accuracy metrics and test predictions\
✅ Created a custom Jupyter viewer for manual data inspection

## 🔮 Prediction Objective

> Given a matchup, predict whether the **home team** wins (`1`) or loses (`0`).

### Features used:

- Team performance averages
- Player stats (PPG, RPG, AST, etc.)
- Game metadata (home/away, season, outcome)
- Opponent statistics
- *(Coming soon)* Momentum, injuries, and team fatigue factors

## 📈 Model Performance (Initial Results)

| Model               | Accuracy | Notes                        |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression | \~XX%    | Baseline model               |
| Decision Tree       | \~XX%    | Overfitting on small samples |
| Random Forest       | Coming   |                              |

> 🔧 Future iterations will include model tuning, cross-validation, and ensembling for better generalization.

## 🧠 Roadmap

- ✅ Combined team_totals.csv and team_summaries.csv into one unified dataset for more comprehensive team statistics.
- ✅ Created a function to simulate game-level data from season statistics, enabling better feature engineering for models.
- ✅ Loaded and processed player stats for each season; display summary statistics and key information in the pipeline.
- ✅ Updated Jupyter converter script to better handle CSV imports (minor improvements).
- ⏳ Next Steps:
  - Develop and expose a Model API for predictions.
  - Build a Streamlit dashboard for interactive results and visualizations.
  - Integrate live NBA data for real-time predictions.
  - Add advanced features: momentum, injuries, and team fatigue factors.
  - Tune models and implement ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest).
  - Optimize code for modularity and scalability.
