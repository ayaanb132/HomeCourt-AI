# 🏀 HomeCourt AI - NBA Game Prediction System

> **A comprehensive machine learning solution for NBA game outcome prediction using advanced basketball analytics**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

HomeCourt AI is a sports analytics project leveraging complete NBA datasets (from 1946 onward) and machine learning to predict basketball game outcomes. The system integrates, cleans, and analyzes historical team and player data to deliver informed, data-driven predictions on home game winners.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

The project’s goal is to build a robust, transparent predictive model that uses the depth of historical NBA performance data to forecast home team victories. By integrating and processing detailed basketball statistics, the model aims to surface key factors that influence game outcomes.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
- 📊 **Data Ingestion:** Combines and cleans comprehensive NBA datasets (player, team, and matchup data from 1946 to present).
- 🔍 **Exploratory Analysis:** Jupyter notebooks for visualization and pattern discovery.
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering:** Merging multiple data sources and transforming statistics into usable inputs.
- 🤖 **Model Training:** Initial machine learning models implemented for home win prediction.
- 📈 **Prediction Engine:** Produces simple outcome probabilities for upcoming matchups.
